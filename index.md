        <center style="padding-right: 80px;">This website is for you, the user. It is what I like to call an "all-purpose destination." Here, you will find news on current events, and my opinion on it. You will also find resources to help with topics, concepts. This is a website you won't want to say goodbye to.

        I am a rising freshman in a Northern Virginia school. A few interests of min are learning, taking opportunities when I find them, and playing sports. Sports that I enjoy playing and watching are Soccer, Basketball, Swimming, and Table Tennis. I have been playing soccer since a very young age, first with CYA and then Loudoun. P.S. I am a huge Messi and Barca fan. This year I started playing at a higher level with Barca Academy, however, due to Covid, I had to stop. Also due to Covid, I started playing tennis, one of the few Social Distancing sports and enjoyed it. In addition to the sports activities I do, I am also a part of several Clubs at school: the Science Olympiad team, MathCounts team, and I am the president of JML’s Model United Nations club. When I’m not playing sports or doing clubs, you can find me reading, writing, learning languages, working on club work, playing the viola or piano, playing fortnite, making legos(I have made the LEGO Taj Mahal, 3rd largest lego set in the world. I'm hoping to make the Bugatti next), coding, learning on Khan Academy(on my way to 1 million points) or taking a course on EDx, playing table tennis, and now, adding on to this website!</br>
